This is a brief look into the history of acoustic guitars. Including the inceptions of the instruments, some of my favorite acoustic guitar variations, and some popular playing styles.


## A Brief History
The acoustic guitar has roots that date back thousands of years, to its ancestors like the oud and loot. Which sprouted up in the middle east and europe respectively. These early instruments used strings made of dried and stretched animal guts with the back of the body being rounded in shape. What we consider a modern acoustic guitar began to take shape in Spain in the late 18th centuries, where luthiers began to refine the shape and size of the guitars. Allowing the instruments to be louder with greater resonance. Later acoustic guitars would gain their standard six steel strings to produce an even louder sound.

## Acoustic Guitar Variations
There have been many variations of acoustic guitars that've been made throughout history, I want to highlight two of my favorites: the **classical**, and the **twelve string** guitar. The classical guitar was first created in Spain in the early 19th century by luthier Antonio de Torres. The guitar had a wider neck than previously and after some time featured six nylon strings for a softer tone to the notes. This guitar would eventually earn itself a spot as a real concert instrument. The twelve string guitar was made in the early 20th century in the United States, born out of a need for a new sound. The twelve paired steel strings are tuned in such a way that the guitar produces a chorus like sound, with a sharpness unlike a normal guitar. Origininally used for folk music the twelve string has grown immensly in popularity with Mexican Corrido music.

## Playstyles
Guitar playing styles have evolved over time and grown with the specific type of guitar the musician is playing. For the earliest forms of acoustic guitars the most popular way to play was by using only your fingertips to manually pluck the individual strings. From this method of playing grew a new style called **flamenco**. In this style the musician would use their whole hand to swipe at the strings, rap their knuckles on the wooden body, and slap the strings to stop the sound. The flamenco style was the preffered method of playing classical guitar. And probably the most popular method today of playing the guitar is with some kind of **plectrum** like a modern day guitar pick, or the original plectrum used to play the oud. In which the picking tool is the main thing used to play the strings.
