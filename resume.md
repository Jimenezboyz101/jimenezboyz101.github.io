# Summary

I’m currently an undergrad working through my Senior year at the University of Washington studying Geographical Information Science. With hands on experience in web programming, spatial analysis, and creating data visualizations. I am drawn to this role because it emphasizes structured support processes, collaborating with a team, and clear documentation. All of which are areas where I have consistently applied my technical and analytical skills in academic and independent project based settings.
